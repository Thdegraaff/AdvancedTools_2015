# Introduction

## Introduction

### Why this workshop?

- In the *social sciences* few attention to what tools to use (and why they make sense)

- \LaTeX is used very much in the scientific world and can *work* together with
	- Stata/R
	- Markdown/HTML
	- Reference managers

- Why *I* want to give this workshop

    - intrinsic interest
    - my goal: pre-conferences workshops / courses

### What I want (and don't want) with this workshop 

- Give a general introduction of why some tools work together

    - Why \LaTeX
    - Why reference managers

- Give an introduction to \LaTeX

    - First the basics
    - Next workshop: some advanced stuff
    
- What *I* do not want

    - Tell you what applications to use (**you** need to decide and make a **well-informed** decision)

# \LaTeX

## Introduction
### Background

- \TeX has been devised by Donald E. Knuth in the late 70's
- \LaTeX is a set of macro's around TeX and devised in the 80's
- \LaTeX is a *typesetting program*, not a *Word processor* 

    - It is actually some code that needs to be compiled
    - Code is typed in by an editor

- So, huge differences between

    - Word processor: Open Office, Word
    - Typesetter: \LaTeX, Adobe's InDesign (in general XML)
    - Editors:
        
        - Specific editors: TexStudio, TexShop, RStudio
        - General editors: Sublime, TextMate, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs
        
## Why \LaTeX

### Disadvantages

- Not WYSIWYG 
- You nead to learn (quite) some commands

    - Learning curve, but
    - hurray for [cheat sheets](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet.pdf) and Google
    
- Difficult to cooperate with people that went to the *dark side*
- *Basic* \LaTeX has *difficulties* with incorporating new fonts (Hoefler, minion pro)

    - XeTeX 
    - For the purists: \LaTeX\ does it right [(\LaTeX vs Word)](http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/2007/05/latex-vs-word-vs-writer/)
    
### Advantages

- Free (as in beer) and ubiquitous
- WYSIWYM
- Consistent lay-out throughout the whole document (including tables, appendices, formulas, source code, etc)
- Internal references are a breeze (references, tables of..., indices)
- Forced to structure documents
- Macros, thus scriptable
- Large community, thus a package for almost everything (books, articles, presentation, posters, exams, musicscores)
- Superior typography & output
- Large publishers (i.e., Elsevier and Springer) have \LaTeX\ templates for their articles

## Technicalities
### How does it work in practice?

- You edit a `.tex` file without thinking about how it looks
    
    - distraction free writing (yeah right)
    
- You then compile it

    - \LaTeX is unforgiving: if there is an error, usually it does not compile
    - Typically, errors are missing brackets or parentheses. 
    
- Typically, source `.tex` file is compiled into `.pdf`

### A process diagram

![Process diagram](fig/process.png)
    
# Workflow: a bigger picture

## Why bother?

### Why bother about workflow or tools?

- Good scientific practice: *document how you have achieved your results*; this ensures

    - Reproducibility 
    - Transparency
    - Modularity
    - Portability (across systems and users)
    - Efficiency
    - Self-sanity

### When should I adopt new tools/workflow?

* The sooner the better (you really have time now)
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly; not in terms of beer but in terms of time)
* Start one step at a time (starting with \LaTeX is a pretty neat idea)

*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step* 

Lao-tzu

### In general

> In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus (Michael Crichton)


### In data science

- Typically, a publication is not at the heart of research

    - Code
    - Data

> The data and code used to make a finding are available and they are sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding (Peng, 2011)

### Code, documentation and output

1. Synonyms

2. All based on `.txt` files 

3. Encompasses almost anything
    - data itself (`.csv`, `.txt`)
    - set of commands for data cleaning and statistical analysis (`.do`, `.R`)
    - database with references (`.bib`)
    - text for articles, presentations or websites (`.tex`, `.html`)
    
4. Only output is displayed/interpreted differently (e.g., in a browser or pdf viewer)

## Folder structure and file names

### Folder structure of your new project (theses, paper, research)

- Think *a priori* about project set-up

    - Seperate analysis, data and output files

- Be careful with source data!

    - Seperate source and derived data files
    - Typically
        
        - you get/collect data
        - transform data
        - analyse data
    
    - Keep track of all these stages!

### Why is version control systems such a neat idea

# Reference managers

## Why?

### Why reference managers?

This is a life saver!

> Use one!

Several applications out there:

- In this case Mendeley (free but not open source)
- Make sure it exports to `.bib` files
- Search for references (google scholar, jstor, etc.)
- Mendeley can import `.pdf`'s

# \LaTeX\ lab

## The basics

### Installation

1. First, install \LaTeX\ 
    - in default location

2. Install, TeXstudio
    - Which can then automatically find \LaTeX\
    
### Basic set-up of a \LaTeX\ file
```{}
\documentclass[]{article}
%opening
\title{}
\author{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\end{abstract}

\section{}

\end{document}
```

### Assignment 1

Create an abstract, title, authors, date, table of contents and create a section and some subsections:

    - Give a date
        - `\date{}`
    - Create subsections: 
        - `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, `\subsubsection{}`, 
        - `\chapter{}`
    - Insert a table of contents
        - `\tableofcontents{}`

### Further text control

- itemization
```{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item bla bla bla
\end{itemize}
```
- enumeration
```{}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item bla bla bla
\end{enumerate}
```
- bold: `\textbf{}`

- emphasize: `\textit{}` or `\emph{}`

### Inserting equations

- Inline: \$e=mc^2\$ will be $e=mc^2$ or
```
\begin{equation}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}
```
will render in 
\begin{equation}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}
- Equations can be as complex (cool) as you want
- [Cheat sheet mathematics:]( http://estudijas.lu.lv/pluginfile.php/14809/mod_page/content/16/instrukcijas/matematika_moodle/LaTeX_Symbols.pdf)

### Assignment 2:

Produce the well-known univariate regression formula:
$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

### Referencing

- Internally: 
    - `\label{}`, `\ref{}`
    
- footnotes (different symbol in title)
    - `\footnote{}`
    
- literature:
    - `cite{}`  
    
- Bibliography:
    - `\bibliography{database1}`
    - for style: `\bibliographystyle{}`
    
### Finally

- Several spaces of new lines are treated as one space or new line 

- Some characters can not be used directly but with `\` in front:
    - not: `#` `$` `%` `^` `&` `_` `{` `}` `~` `\`
    - but: `\#` `\$` `\%` `\^` `\&` `\_` `\{` `\}` `\~` `\\`

- Commands always start with `\`

- Comments start with `%`

# Next time

## Next workshop

### What are we going to do next time?

- Use of packages
- Figures
- Tables
- Automating `do` file outputs
- Slides
