# Introduction

## Previous tutorial

Still somewhat more theoretical (why do you want to change tools)

- Importance of writing things down (reproducability)
- Text files are the bomb:

    - scriptable
    - input and output in/for other applications
    
- pros and cons of \LaTeX

## This tutorial

More practical, play around with \LaTeX. In specific:

- packages (make things look better)
- figures (usually import them, but sometime make them yourself)
- tables (import them!)
- slides (just copy & paste from `.tex` document)

# Making appearances

## The use of packages

There are lots of them, see [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org)

## The use of classes

## Bibliopgraphy

# Better graphs

## Import them

## Making them yourself

# Better tables

## Some guidelines

## Importing them

# Making slides

## Pros and cons

## Using beamer package
