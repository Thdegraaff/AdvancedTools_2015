### Introduction

Contrary to what many people believe, there are very good alternatives to `Word` and `Powerpoint`. In the scientific world, though far less in the social sciences, the typesetting program `LaTeX` is often used. In many ways, including style, consistency, performance, and reproducability, `LaTeX` i`s far more superior than `Word`. The downside is that `LaTeX` has a far steeper learning curve than `Word`. We therefore decided to give two introductionary workshops for those students who are interested in using `LaTeX` and are willing to give it a try. Be warned, deciding to use new tools are costly in terms of time. However, in the end it is hopefully very rewarding, if not for only getting these pesky references right.
