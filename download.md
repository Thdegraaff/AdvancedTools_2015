## Which stuff to download

Please make sure that for the start of the workshop you have both
`LaTeX` and `TexStudio` installed and working. 

1. First install a `LaTeX` distribution:
    * __Windows__ [Miktex](http://miktex.org/) : The most used _LaTeX_ distribution for windows
    * __Mac__ [MacTex package](https://tug.org/mactex/) : Most complete
      distribution for OsX
    * [https://www.latex-project.org/get/](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) :
      Gives a good overview of other applications for various platform
      (including on-line) 

2. Then a `LaTeX` editor, in this case:
    * __Windows__ [TexStudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) : An intuitive editor
    * __Mac__ [TexStudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) : An intuitive editor

Note: I will use **TexStudio** but any good editor will do. **TexStudio** just
works quite well *out of the box*.

To check whether `LaTeX` is installed open a new file from template
`File > New From Template > Article` and press `F1`. It could be that
`TeXstudio` asks you to save the file first. If it does not work,
please contact [me](t.de.graaff@vu.nl). 

## Additional stuff that might be handy

We will discuss the usage of Bibtex in combination with reference
managers. Two good reference managers are:

* Reference managers:
    * [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) : Free, but not open source
    * [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) :  Open source

But to be honest, we will be mainly using Google Scholar in combination with *BibTex*.
